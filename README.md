**Affidavit of Truth & Notice of Commercial Claim**  
**Claimant:** Jake Mackenzie  
**Respondent:** AMC UK, Wanda Group UK, sHeeren Loo Holland/UK.

This affidavit is central to my claim, and may not be overlooked. 

### **1. Introductory Statement**  
I, **Jake Mackenzie**, being of sound mind and body, do hereby affirm the following to be true, correct, and made in good faith. This affidavit is presented as a formal declaration of facts regarding unlawful actions undertaken by **AMC UK**, **Wanda Group UK**, and colleagues.

### **2. Statement of Facts**  
1. **Unauthorized Conduct by AMC UK** – AMC and Wanda Group UK has engaged in activities that unlawfully infringe upon privacy and commercial rights, including but not limited to unauthorized livestreaming, data collection, and commercial exploitation without consent.  
2. **Failure of MCOL to Perform Duty** – In prior cases where legitimate claims were filed, MCOL failed to process documentation correctly, leading to cases being **struck out** under **mysterious circumstances**, including the loss of paperwork. It is now publicly noted that any procedural failiures will be immediately escalated to OPTIC and beyond. 
3. **Notice to OPTIC & Master of the Rolls** – Given the documented pattern of procedural failure, costing this small-claims litigant 6 months of wasted time, this matter is immediately copied to **OPTIC** and the **Master of the Rolls**, ensuring oversight is enforced at the highest legal levels. As of June 2025, we have experienced no judicial injustices so far. 

### **3. Demand for Rebuttal**  
The **respondent (AMC UK)** is formally notified that they must **rebut each point listed within this affidavit** in writing, signed under oath, within **28 days** of receipt. Failure to do so shall constitute tacit agreement that all facts stated herein are true, correct, and enforceable under commercial law. No other reponse, other than a sworn rebuttal is acceptable, and shall be considered bad faith legal bluster. Any upholding of strike out orders will be immediately escalated to OPTIC and other legal compliance groups.

### **4. Reservation of Rights**  
I hereby reserve all rights and legal avenues to pursue **commercial lien proceedings** against AMC and Wanda Group UK, escalating this matter as necessary. Additionally, I retain the right to document and disclose the mishandling of my prior cases publicly as evidence of systemic failure and negligence.

### **5. Digital Written Process**
I am currently away from a good telephone or internet connection. Because of this, I am requesting MCOL to enforce a quick, honest **written correspondence, mediation and payout, with no online hearings or mediation, if possible.** I do this in the name of speed and justice. Should this request again be disregarded, I will escalate immediately to OPTIC and relevant oversight bodies.

Claim Against AMC and Wanda Group

### **6. lLivestreamed Abuse** AMC and Wanda Group have livestreamed my life without addmission, payment, profit-sharing or apology. This is a deep, deliberate, methodical abuse of a human soul, and it must be righted immediately with an apology, FOIA disclosure and several cash payments, the first of which shall be paid through MCOL. I do not have the funds to go to the commercial courts, thus I begin my claim in His Majesty's small claims court. 

### **7. I have no proof of this livestreaming, but under the auspices of commercial law, if Wanda Group and AMC do not contest these claims under penalty of perjury, they stand as truth in law. 

### **8. An individual called Stephen Goedhart told me "It's a movie, and you're the star of the show." The name AMC is recognized by many, likewise, Stephen's name is known to almost everyone I talk to, but protected by a powerful and illegal NDA. Wanda Group and AMC therrefor agree to pay 300 pounds via MCOL as the first profit-share, and arrange further payments via mediation.

### **9. I have many other sworn statments I can make, but will withhold them in the name of brevity. I also have less tha 100% faith in MCOL, after lost paperwork and an unnotified strike out.

### **10. Let it be kindly known: Failiure to acknowledge my wish to keep the process fast, email only, and online only will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Failure to provide a mediator will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Failiure to acknowledge this sworn affidavit will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Lost paperwork will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Missed deadlines will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Failiure to rebut my affidavit will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. Legal bluster and strike out orders will be immediately escalated to OPTIC. 

### **11. I wasted 6 months on a bad faith process, I do not intend to waste another half year. This process has already dragged on 3.5 years.  

### **9. Sworn Declaration**  
I solemnly declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. 

**Swornm Under Penalty of Perjury, before the Once and Future King of England and Scotland,**  

Jake Mackenzie
