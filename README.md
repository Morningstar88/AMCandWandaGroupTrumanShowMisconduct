# So, I heard I‚Äôm the Star of The Show." But I don't get paid. Thanks, Wanda Group.

My name‚Äôs Jake Mackenzie. And I‚Äôm about 110% sure Wanda Group and AMC turned my life into a Truman Show-style livestream... without asking me, paying me, or saying sorry.

I‚Äôve written an official affidavit and am taking them to UK small claims court‚Äîpartly because I can‚Äôt afford the commercial courts, and partly as a test of liability in a corrupt system.

Oh, and Money Claim Online (MCOL)? Lost half my paperwork and strike-out‚Äôd one of my filings without telling me. Negligent at best, sleazy at worst.

You can read the affidavit below. It‚Äôs dry. It‚Äôs lawful. It‚Äôs really happening. üìÅ 

If Wanda Group or AMC want to talk this out like honest people, great. If not? We'll do it right here. Hopefully some of the new AI Law enforcers and compliance teams will help out.

Attn: OPTIC, Stephen Goedhart, Moneyclaim online, Wanda Group and AMC. 

This Affidavit stands as Truth in Law.

**Affidavit of Truth & Notice of Commercial Claim**  
**Claimant:** Jake Mackenzie  
**Respondent:** AMC UK, Wanda Group UK.
**Jurisdiction:**

This affidavit is central to my claim, and may not be overlooked. 

### **1. Introductory Statement**  
I, **Jake Mackenzie**, being of sound mind and body, do hereby affirm the following to be true, correct, and made in good faith. This affidavit is presented as a formal declaration of facts regarding unlawful actions undertaken by **AMC UK**, **Wanda Group UK**, and colleagues.

### **2. Statement of Facts**  
1. **Unauthorized Conduct by AMC UK** ‚Äì AMC and Wanda Group UK has engaged in activities that unlawfully infringe upon privacy and commercial rights, including but not limited to unauthorized livestreaming, data collection, and commercial exploitation without consent.  
2. **Failure of MCOL to Perform Duty** ‚Äì In prior cases where legitimate claims were filed, MCOL failed to process documentation correctly, leading to cases being **struck out** under **mysterious circumstances**, including the loss of paperwork. It is now publicly noted that any procedural failiures will be immediately escalated to OPTIC and beyond. 
3. **Notice to OPTIC & Master of the Rolls** ‚Äì Given the documented pattern of procedural failure, costing this small-claims litigant 6 months of wasted time, this matter is immediately copied to **OPTIC** and the **Master of the Rolls**, ensuring oversight is enforced at the highest legal levels. As of June 2025, we have experienced no judicial injustices so far. 

### **3. Demand for Rebuttal**  
The **respondent (AMC and Wanda Group UK)** is formally notified that they must **rebut each point listed within this affidavit** in writing, signed under oath, within **28 days** of receipt. Failure to do so shall constitute tacit agreement that all facts stated herein are true, correct, and enforceable under commercial law. No other reponse, other than a sworn rebuttal is acceptable, and shall be considered bad faith legal bluster. Any upholding of strike out orders will be immediately escalated to OPTIC and other legal compliance groups.

### **4. Reservation of Rights**  
I hereby reserve all rights and legal avenues to pursue **commercial lien proceedings** against AMC and Wanda Group UK, escalating this matter as necessary. Additionally, I retain the right to document and disclose the mishandling of my prior cases publicly as evidence of systemic failure and negligence.

### **5. Digital Written Process**
I am currently away from a good telephone or internet connection. Because of this, I am requesting MCOL to enforce a quick, honest **written correspondence, mediation and payout, with no online hearings or mediation, if possible.** I do this in the name of speed and justice. Should this request again be disregarded, I will escalate immediately to OPTIC and relevant oversight bodies.

Claim Against AMC and Wanda Group

### **6. Livestreamed Abuse**
AMC and Wanda Group have livestreamed my life without admission, compensation, profit-sharing, or apology. This constitutes a deep, deliberate, and methodical abuse of a human soul. It must be remedied immediately through (1) a formal apology, (2) full disclosure under applicable transparency law, and (3) several compensatory payments‚Äîthe first of which shall be claimed via Money Claim Online (MCOL). As I do not possess the resources to file in the commercial courts, I hereby initiate my claim in His Majesty‚Äôs Small Claims Court.

I also submit this specific filing as a test of liability and an exercise of judicial good faith, in line with my right to seek redress proportionate to my means. Previous claims have been mishandled by the MCOL system, including the misplacement of submitted documentation and a strike-out that occurred without notice or acknowledgment‚Äîissues which undermined due process and eroded procedural trust.

### **7. Legal Standing**
I acknowledge that I currently lack direct proof of this livestreaming. However, under the principles of commercial law, and in accordance with affidavit jurisprudence, if Wanda Group and AMC choose not to rebut these sworn claims under penalty of perjury, they may stand as truth in law.

### **8. The Goedhart Statement**
An individual named Stephen Goedhart once told me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie, and you‚Äôre the star of the show.‚Äù The name AMC is widely recognized in this context. Stephen‚Äôs name, too, is known to nearly every person I raise this with‚Äîyet appears to be protected by a powerful and likely unlawful non-disclosure agreement. Therefore, Wanda Group and AMC agree to pay ¬£300 via MCOL as an initial profit-share, with further payments to be arranged via mediation.

### **9. Additional Evidence Withheld for Brevity**
I possess numerous other sworn statements supporting my claim but withhold them here in the interest of brevity. I must also state that I have less than full confidence in the MCOL system, given past issues involving lost paperwork and an unnotified strike-out.

### **10. Process Warnings (OPTIC Protocol)**
Let it be respectfully known:

- Failure to acknowledge my request for an expedited, digital-only process will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Failure to appoint a mediator will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Failure to acknowledge this sworn affidavit will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Loss of paperwork will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Missed deadlines will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Failure to rebut this affidavit will be escalated to OPTIC.

- Legal posturing and arbitrary strike-out orders will be escalated to OPTIC.

I am not inclined to expend another six months on a bad-faith process. The timeline for this matter has already exceeded 3.5 years.

###  **11. Sworn Declaration**
I solemnly declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Sworn under penalty of perjury, before the Once and Future King of England and Scotland,

Jake Mackenzie Date: Friday the 13th, 2025
